## To do

- general pagination utils (extract from the help command functionality)
  - Select menu to go straight to a page
- Move helpSelectMenu (src/utils/help) to somewhere else?

## Future work

- [ ] Add support for running an express server (separate /src/server folder, with subfolders for routes, middleware, etc.)
